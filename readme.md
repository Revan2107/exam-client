My first variation of solution had **HUGE** performance issue but that was done in the same day I got it. So I decided
to spend time for optimization.
So, for comparing first demo was performed in 1 minute 47 seconds... Not so good as for me :)
But now it's 20 seconds (still isn't perfect but pretty better), and I guess I can present it for you now.

Sorry for delay, hope all will run accurate.
